    <h2>About images</h2>
    <p id='getBigger'>The thing above is called an image, a visual graphic that tells many things like a picture. It can
        have different
        forms like PNG and JPEG To make an image in
        HTML, you use the <img> tag and inside of it has
        different attributes. The common ones in img are src which tells the source of the image. The source can be the
        image file. The alt attribute tells the alternate text if the image gets broken. They are often linked or
        embedded into webpages.</p>
