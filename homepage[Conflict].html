    <p style="font-style: italic;"> Updated: June 20, 2021</p>
    <p>This website is the root of all the websites I made but there's more to this website. </p>
    <p>This website would have a journal, important dates to mark and other websites to visit. </p>
    <h2>What happened</h2>
    <h3>June 13 Part 1:</h3>
    <div>There are tons of things that happened since I edited this site. I delayed because of all the school work and other things that I had to do. 
        One thing that has happened since I last written this site is that India had a tour with England and won! That means 2 tours won, right! Next
        it is going to face off with New Zealand in the test finals! By the way there were no videos for the England tour. Also there is going to be a 
        T20 World cup later this year. Since the Pongual day I was sad a bit but then it gone away. Since then the monitor has moved to the masters to 
        never be used again and then that table has joined in with the single table we have been using to create a double table for our feet space to 
        increase. We watched random at first then we did Henry Danger then Netflix ended. We started Prime and I watched Gortimer Gibbons. Then bad batch
        came and we had disney plus. Part 2 is in the next section.</div>
        <br>
    <h3>June 13 Part 2:</h3>
    <div> After we watched bad batch we moved to race to center of Earth in which South east Asia won. We started watching Loki.
         You might be wondering what happened to the school things. So the assignments were normal but I got B in both quarters for Math. All others were A.
         In health we moved from mental health to substance abuse to family life. In science we moved from human body to genetics to physics. Then we reviewed
         with blooket and various methods. In reading did a essay about Refugee. We finished animal farm then moved to refugee. Social Studies moved to many 
         themes and in Math moved from algebra to geometry. Since this is so long I am going to do a part 3.
    </div>
    <br>
    <h3>June 13 Part 3:</h3>
    <div>In tech we did various things and in STEM we didn't have to do and I will say the reason later. We moved from plan B to C to B to Plan A.
        During plan A, since we were in the school fully, there wasn't the need for virtual things to happen. So they put projects but there were no
        school assignments. Speaking of Plan A, the EOG's came and there were different days for different people and subjects like ELA, Math, Virtual, 
        In school and Science (8th grade). We had to do EOG's in school and I am waiting to go to school to get the scores. We had field day but virtual students
        couldn't participate with in person students but had to do the field day through slideshow. We had award ceremony at the second last day of shcool and last 
        day of school, there wasn't really anything to do there. We are going to do a 4th part.
    </div>
    <br>
    <h3>June 13 Part 4:</h3>
    <div>We brought back the monitor downstairs a few weeks ago and now it is residing near the TV. In gardening, there are many successes since we brought in more 
        new plants like leafy greens, marigold, lavender, daisy, zinnia, cucumber, viola and more. Old plants like bell peppers and tomatoes are staying. 
        Successes are that 3 zinnias bloomed in light pink, pink and reddish pink. A 4th zinnia is about to bloom. Many marigolds bloomed and they give a reddish color
        at first but then turn orange. The tomato is growing big but I think it is a different variety. The cucumbers are growing big and had vines and flowers.
        There is also one viola. There are many more things I want to mention but there is no time. I also got mad at something a few months ago (won't mention it)
        and then I moved daddy's and mommy's offices to masters. I also broke the blind which daddy tried to fix but broke again. Daddy and mommy punished me for those 
        by making me sleep in the loft. Now daddy's and mommy's offices are in the masters and I moved to my room for a brief time before I had to work downstairs with 
        Daddy and Mommy. We also dug more new spots and planted more new things. Part 5 is next. </div>
        <br>
    <h3>June 13 Part 5:</h3>
    <div>We also had Adhi's birthday which was many kinds of foods like puttu which was bannana in 
        flour which was delicious. We also had other things and they were also delicious. We brought back pizza and bread day back again. Recently, Daddy thrown away a lot
        of things. First he thrown away the new boxes and then when he saw that papa's room was a mess (she threw stuff there yesterday) he thrown away Cali's playhouse and most
        of her drawings. He took most of her toys downstairs and boxes she used as a closets are thrown away. He then struck my room throwing away my box holding the monitor and 
        but the monitor downstairs where it is being used with the computer. He also thrown away most of Adhi's things that were in my room. My frostbite has been gone. 
        This is all for the journal.</div>
