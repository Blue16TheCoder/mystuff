    March 18th: Plenty of stuff happened now that its about 2 months. I don't think we had a snow day but I don't know
    when. It's been so long. School has changed too. Our math teacher has left and now we're waiting for our new math
    teacher to come.
    Also wordle is getting popular and getting plenty of spinoffs. Many units have came and went. Unit 3 is now ending.
    It's getting close to the end of the year. I am finishing up my school work great. We had EOG's yesterday and the
    day before but I didn't do good (78 and
    76). March madness came which is the next thing. There wasn't much except that a team that hasn't won a march
    madness match, beat a number 2 seeded team (2nd top team). Not too much in gardening except that a tree was leaning
    heavily.
    That came after strong winds came and made power outages. Also speaking of power outages, Tesla came and fixed the
    wire and now we're making 30-40 kilowatts. Now Tesla works done after 4 months. Also since Fresh costs keep rising
    and everything gets out of stock, we decided to cancel Fresh and go to Aldi and Walmart. Since we didn't need Fresh,
    we canceled Amazon Prime. That means we can't watch Prime anymore. Also adding to that, daddy canceled Disney and
    Netflix since they were taking up a lot of money. Hulu and HBO max were gone. This meant that the only thing to
    watch was Youtube.
    Fortunately daddy found movies to watch there and we can watch anything there.
