    June 30: Way more things these past days. First it's almost 3 months away from the last post. Plenty of things have happened
    since then. One thing is that school ended long ago. The units flew by and ended with the EOG's and one of the EOG's (the Math one)
    was 4 hours long. I did get a 5 for Math and Science but was only one point away to getting a 5 in ALPS. Second, spring break came 
    and we went to the smokies. The only difference was that the hotel, The Central Hotel, was more luxurious and cleaner, and we went
    more attractions, most on the 4th day (being lazy other days). We brought in bread and PB plus more on the trip (we're still eating
     PB which is peanut butter). We didn't do much other than preparing and resting. During the trip we found a new TV show, Agents of 
     Shield and are currently watching it. And this Agents of Shield is in Disney Plus which brings next good news. Daddy brought back 
     Disney Plus, Hulu, HBO max and had new things like Vudu and freevee which we couldn't watch because they weren't too good or they 
     weren't free. Tesla has been being normal but sometimes making 50-60 kilowatts a day and we crushed monthly and yearly records. We 
     got our new math teacher and had field day which was fun. March Madness was finished with 1 seeded Jayhawks winning against NC state.
     Speaking of the bracket, we did a stock market challenge but it was held at a bad time because most people couldn't gain profits.
     During the summer, we went to many shopping places like the Carolina Mall, Carowinds (fun theme park that is similar to wild adventures)
     and Dave's and Busters. There's lot more during these three months but I think these are important.
