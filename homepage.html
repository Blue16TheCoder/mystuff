  <h2>My journal</h2>
  <div>
    July 19: Not too much 2 days later. We watched more TV but didn't have computer until today. We also went to Azure
    when they finished unloading. I also saw how the neighborhood Walmart grocery was like and it was like Earthfare.
    We did lots of programming, making coding projects. We walked a lot and even went to Addison Park which was in its
    later stages. In gardening we were flipping the stones and we did lots of progress. We only have one tree well left.
