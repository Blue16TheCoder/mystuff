    <p style="font-style: italic">Updated: January 22, 2022</p>
    <p>
      This website is the root of all the websites I made but there's more to
      this website. I would also tell about other programs and things in this
      website.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website has a journal, important dates to mark, other websites to
      visit and what's new in this website and others.
    </p>

    <h2>My journal</h2>
    <div>
      Febuary 19th: Plenty of stuff happened now that its exactly a month.
    </div>
    <div></div>
    <h2>Febuary 2022 dates</h2>
    <div>Febuary 20-21: Long weekend</div>
    <div>Febuary 21: No school</div>
    <div>Febuary 21: Presidents day</div>

    <h2>What's new in my programs</h2>
    <div>
      I'm starting my renovations. There's not much I can do but I changed the
      styles and added a new calendar. I changed the title of this website. I
      did some changes in the paragraphs. I plan to make an seperate website
      where it shows what's new with my websites and the status they're in.
