    <p style="font-style: italic">Updated: January 22, 2022</p>
    <p>
      This website is the root of all the websites I made but there's more to
      this website. I would also tell about other programs and things in this
      website.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website has a journal, important dates to mark, other websites to
      visit and what's new in this website and others.

    <h2>My journal</h2>
    <div>
      January 19th: Some more things happened. Today's not a school day because
      of the snow that's still there. Not much in gardening but South Africa won
      the first ODI against India. So that means school might start tomorrow or
      not. Other than that there wasn't much.

    <h2>What's new in my programs</h2>
    <div>
      I'm starting my renovations. There's not much I can do but I changed the
      styles and added a new calendar. I changed the title of this website. I
      did some changes in the paragraphs. I plan to make an seperate website
      where it shows what's new with my websites and the status they're in.
