    <p>This website has a journal, important dates to mark and other websites to visit. </p>

    <h2>What happened based on what I know:</h2>
    <div> 
        December 24 (Part 1)- A lot has happened since October since that now we're in winter break which is going to end on January 3, 2022.
          Unfortunately a lot of plants died in the garden but they would've died in the winter. The amaranth plant was growing really big.
          Also we got no sweet potatoes since only roots have grown and not any edible parts of an potato.
          Since October, the Cricket t20 world cup happened and India lost against Pakistan by 10 wickets! It's the first time they lost against
          Pakistan in an world cup. They also lost against New Zealand which made them eliminated from world cup. Another shocking thing was that
          West Indies scored 55 all out against England in their first match. West Indies has won 2 t20 world cups making them have the greatest amount
          of world cups won. The semifinal matches were England v New Zealand and Pakistan v Australia. New Zealand and Australia won the semis but 
          Australia won against New Zealand by 8 wickets making Australia win their first T20 world cup. My 14th birthday has passed.

        December 24 (Part 2) - We started watching Avatar: The last Airbender on Netflix and Prime. Also, I got injured in my knee again on the end of 1st 
        quarter and it took a few weeks to heal. Now we're in second quarter on P.E and we did our unit on flag football. Our team played some games and we
        did pretty good with a record of 5 wins and 3 losses. We ran the mile and I got a score of 11:18 which is good. Other than that, not much has happened
        in my other classes other than learning westward expansion in Social Studies and Geology in Science. For the first quarter, I got straight A's in all
        my subjects and so far in second quarter it's still straight A's. That's pretty much it.
