    <h2>What happened based on what I know:</h2>
    <div>October 9 (Saturday)- There was so much that has happened. Since June, we had a fun summer and did many things like
        computer, watching TV, working on garden, playing board games but we did not go on any trips except to the local high
        school. We had school and we learned many things in chemistry for science. We did projects for Stem and we're doing
        paragraphs for ELA. In social studies, we did American revolution stuff and we did robotics for tech. In health, 
        we did mental health and CPR (chest only). In math, we learned functions and algebra. Since the last time we did this,
        India did a tour with Sri Lanka and drawn since in the ODI, India won but since they put the best players for England, 
        they lost in the T20. For the England tour, they had won and now are doing IPL. I think that is going to finish in a couple
        of days or in a week and the world cup is going to start.</div>
        
        <div>The garden has grown beautifully, with Amaranth flowering and 
        zinnias had grown so huge. The big purple zinnia has grown and gave beautiful flowers. The marigolds have grown great but 
        some are dying. Sweet potato had its leaves eaten but had made a good comeback. Cucumbers gave many fruit but died somewhere
        in August. This year, we had less cherry tomatoes but a variety of tomato plants with many tomatoes being used on our weekly feast.
        They had helped us still eat tomato when there were none from the fridge. The onion is growing great in the forest and now we are using
        variety of vegetables and planting them by cuttings. The abelia cuttings have succeded with one of them giving flowers. Violas died in July
        probably because of the rain. The lavender died, daisy and this ornamental shrub that is still growing well. We decided to do stone sidings
        and put some stones. We are still planing for more stones. Since June, the solar panel order is doing great with approval and the building date
        to be October 27. We had got some myrtle trees from Home depot and planted it. We also had moved the lawn since the grass was growing tall. </div>
