    <p style="font-style: italic;"> Updated: January 10, 2022</p>
    <p>This website is the root of all the websites I made but there's more to this website. </p>
    <p>This website has a journal, important dates to mark, other websites to visit and what's new in this website and
        others.</p>

    <h2>What happened based on what I know:</h2>
    <div>
        January 9th: Not much has happened from the 3rd except that we finished Avatar on the same day but later in night. School resumed and we did benchmark
        testing and I got a 80 in math. There were some hard questions so it would be a bit higher. Science benchmark is going to come soon. Other than that
        not much has happened in gardening or school. India won one test match and South Africa another.
