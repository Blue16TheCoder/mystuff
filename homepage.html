      This website is the root of all the websites I made but there's more to
      this website. I would also tell about other programs and things in this
      website.

    <h2>What happened based on what I know:</h2>
    <div>
      January 18th: Many things happened. After we finished Avatar, we watched
      Lost in Space which is 1 hour per epidsode and Legends of Korra, sequel of
      Avatar. Also day before yesterday we had an snow day! There were a few
      inches of snow. First we planned what we would do in snow day and then we
      played but only for a few minutes. Then we drank ginger tea and watched
      some TV. We also had pongual yesterday. We had many things like Rice
      pongual, Millet pongual, two different kinds of chutneys, sambar and
      idlies. We also had bread day on Saturday. Lot of the potted plants we had
      died since we put them outside. We are having the 4-day break from school.
      Right now I have two B's in 2nd quarter which ended last friday. That ends
      my streak of all A's since first quarter. I got those two B's because I
      didn't do well on those assignments. In NFL, Cowboys lost (Adhi's favorite
      team) and 49ers won (my fav team). Patriots and Raiders lost. And Bengals
      won a playoff game since a very long time. Buccaneers and Cheifs won their
      games but sadly Cardinals (Another fav) lost against Rams. Now the Wild
      Card has been done with Division to go. Now Adhi's another favorite teams
      is Titans which are playing Bengals. South Africa won third test match
      winning the test series.

    <div>
      Updated journal and calander. I also added Febuary calander. In The stats
      website, I removed the new year banner. I plan to make small changes. In
      the Learning Javascript website, I added some style but it needs more
      style and I plan to add an Navbar. I also plan to add more things about
      Javascript in the near future. I formatted the PrimeNumbers.html and
      changed colors to be more user friendly. I plan to change color in the
      random background color. I am currently doing fishy.html.
